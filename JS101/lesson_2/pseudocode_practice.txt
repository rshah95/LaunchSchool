1. function returning sum of two numbers

START 

GET number one from user and SET to variable

GET number two from user and SET to variable

ADD numbers and PRINT output

2. Takes array of strings and returns all strings in array concatenated

START

SET array = array of strings

SET string = array[0]

ITERATE through array and add each string to the new string variable

PRINT string variable

3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element from the original array, starting with the first element

Declare a function that takes an array as argument

  Initialize empty array

  Iterate through array 
    - check value is integer
    - first value added to new array
    - if not first value, only add next value to array if integer and if iterator % 2 is 0

  Return new array

Call function with desired array 
Print returned array


4. a function that determines the index of the 3rd occurrence of a given character in a string.

Declare function that takes character as input
  - Confirm input is single character
  - initialize varaible to act as counter
  - initialize variable to represent string index
  - iterate through string 
    - if value equals input character, add one to counter
      - check counter to see if counter = 3
      - if counter = 3, set string index to iterator + 1
  - If string index variable does not equal undefined, return value
    - else return null
