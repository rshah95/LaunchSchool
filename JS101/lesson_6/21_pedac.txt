  a) calculate total for user
    - requires function bc of aces
  b) display total to user
  c) prompt user to hit or stay
    - if hit, distribute another card
      - calculate and display total
      - identify if bust - if bust, skip to step 5

6. Track score of rounds won

7. ask user if they want to play again

// Examples and test cases 

full test case not provided


// Data Structures

 - Deck of Cards structured in Object
   each round conducted by making copy of object into array with Object.entries()

 - Scoreboard stored in an object and dispalyed at the end of each round 

 - Totals of each hand stored in an array for each individual game 


// Algorithms

 - Pick card to give to player by generating random number for suit (1 - 4) and random number for each card (1 - 13)
 - Remove card from deck so it can not be distributed twice within a round 

 - Card value designation 
   - 1 - 9 worth value
   - 1-, J , Q , K worth 10 
   - A worth 11 unless it moves total over 21 --> then worth 1
     - if worth 1 and still puts total over 21, then bust
